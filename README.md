# MultiThreadingdsdsd
Join method can be used to pause the current thread execution untill and unless the specified thread is dead.By using the join it can ensured that main() is the last thread to finish in java.

Wait Vs Sleep
1. wait() is from object and sleep() is the static method of the thread.
2.wait() releases the lock while sleep doesn't releases the lock while waiting.
3.context : wait() method can only be called from synchronized context i.e. by using synchronized block or synchronized method. sleep() method can be called from any context.
4. wait() : A waiting thread can be awaked by notify() or notifyall() . A sleep thread can be awaked by interrupt or when the time expires.

Daemon Thread:
---------------
A Daemon thread is a thread that doesn't prevent the JVM from exiting when the program finishes but the thread is still runnning. An example of daemon thread in garbage collector.
setDaemon(boolean) can be used to change the thread daemon properties before the thread start.

Thread Dump
------------
Thread dump is list of all the threads active in the JVM, thread dumps are very helpful in analyzing bottlenecks in the application and analyzing deadlock situations. There are many ways using which we can generate Thread dump – Using Profiler, Kill -3 command, jstack tool etc

ThreadLocal:
-------------
The ThreadLocal class in Java enables you to create variables that can only be read and written by the same thread. Thus, even if two threads are executing the same code, and the code has a reference to a ThreadLocal variable, then the two threads cannot see each other's ThreadLocal variables.or like the class or object scope this variable will have the scope of the Thread.

Why thread communication methods wait(), notify() and notifyAll() are in Object class?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Java every Object has a monitor and wait, notify methods are used to wait for the Object monitor or to notify other threads that Object monitor is free now. There is no monitor on threads in java and synchronization can be used with any Object, that’s why it’s part of Object class so that every class in java has these essential methods for inter thread communication.

When a Thread calls wait() on any Object, it must have the monitor on the Object that it will leave and goes in wait state until any other thread call notify() on this Object. Similarly when a thread calls notify() on any Object, it leaves the monitor on the Object and other waiting threads can get the monitor on the Object. Since all these methods require Thread to have the Object monitor, that can be achieved only by synchronization, they need to be called from synchronized method or block.

Atomic operations:
Atomic operations are performed in a single unit of task without interference from other operations, atomic operations are necessary in multi-threaded environment to avoid data inconsistency
e.g. using count.increamentAndGet() instead of count++ in a multi threaded environement.

Lock vs synchronized:
--------------------------
Java Lock API provides more visibility and options for locking, unlike synchronized where a thread might end up waiting indefinitely for the lock, we can use tryLock() to make sure thread waits for specific time only.
Synchronization code is much cleaner and easy to maintain whereas with Lock we are forced to have try-finally block to make sure Lock is released even if some exception is thrown between lock() and unlock() method calls.
synchronization blocks or methods can cover only one method whereas we can acquire the lock in one method and release it in another method with Lock API.
synchronized keyword doesn’t provide fairness whereas we can set fairness to true while creating ReentrantLock object so that longest waiting thread gets the lock first.
We can create different conditions for Lock and different thread can await() for different conditions.

Executor Framework:
--------------------
Concurrent utility framwork in java and is used for standardizing invokation, scheduling, execution and control of asynchronous tasks in parallel threads.
Once the thread has delegated the task to the ExecutorService, the thread continues its own execution independent of the execution of that task.
Executor Service Shutdown: On invoking the shutdown() command all the executor service thread gets terminated but it won't get shutdowned immediately but it will no longer accept new tasks, and once all threads have finished current tasks, the ExecutorService shuts down. 

Diference between Runnable() and Callable()
-------------------------------------------
Callable can return the result of an operation performed inside call method.So basically Callable can return any object and able to throw an exception.

LIvelock Vs Deadlock : A livelock is similar to a deadlock, except that the states of the threads or processes involved in the livelock constantly change with regard to one another, without any one progressing further. Livelock is a special case of resource starvation. A real-world example of livelock occurs when two people meet in a narrow corridor, and each tries to be polite by moving aside to let the other pass, but they end up swaying from side to side without making any progress because they both repeatedly move the same way at the same time

Other Points:
-----------------
1) A method called holdsLock() on java.lang.Thread, it returns true if and only if the current thread holds the monitor lock on the specified object, using this it can be verified the thread holdds the lock or not.
2)
